## Hi there! <img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9fcde363f6e46385fd7bc47ef8edd937acaa2c872216105ab0475369f1c1a005/68747470733a2f2f656d6f6a69732e736c61636b6d6f6a69732e636f6d2f656d6f6a69732f696d616765732f313533363335313037352f343539342f626c6f622d776176652e676966" width="32">

I'm [Emir](https://emirow.github.io/my-cv-site/), a junior Frontend developer based in Almaty.

I’m learning web development through hands-on practice and personal projects, focusing on building simple, clean, and well-structured interfaces. I aim to understand how modern websites work — from layout and styling to basic JavaScript logic — rather than just copying ready-made solutions.

Currently, I’m working on small projects to strengthen my foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to get comfortable using Git and GitHub as part of my workflow.

I’m motivated to grow into a strong frontend developer, learn from real-world tasks, and eventually contribute to production-level projects in a team environment.

Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring how technology works, improving my skills step by step, and building things that feel complete and polished.

Let’s connect 🙂
